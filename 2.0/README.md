This is my personal website (my portfolio website is the static page located at lawrencetsai.github.io). It has such things as my resume, fun text games, and blog posts. It also hosts some miscellaneous files.

## About the website
Made mostly using HTML, CSS, and JS using [React](https://reactjs.org/). I used [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for the terminal look and [fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for the fuzzy searching.

I wrote my own file tree navigation system. Inspiration came from [this](https://github.com/Swordfish90/cool-retro-term) retro terminal emulator.
